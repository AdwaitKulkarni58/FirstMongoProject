### This is my first experience with Mongoose and MongoDB and no-SQL databases in general in my journey to become familiar with the MERN stack.   
### Nothing fancy here, just a Node.js application containing the creation of a database with the help of Mongoose, and then carrying out manual CRUD operations to test my knowledge.
